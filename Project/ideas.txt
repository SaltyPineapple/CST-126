When each user is registerred, create their own table to hold their posts
Table name will be their username since it is unique


for date, just insert SELECT GETDATE() into that position


SQL for this
CREATE TABLE $username{
    Username VARCHAR 16
    Date VARCHAR
    Title VARCHAR
    Post VARCHAR
    
}


When deleting a user, have to add in drop table function as well
