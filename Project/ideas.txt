When each user is registerred, create their own table to hold their posts
Table name will be their username since it is unique


for date, just insert SELECT GETDATE() into that position


SQL for this
CREATE TABLE $username{
    Username VARCHAR 16
    Date VARCHAR
    Title VARCHAR
    Post VARCHAR
    
}


for search and display all.

do display all page first. have search button on page

Search takes us to new page with criteria and then takes us to new page with results
